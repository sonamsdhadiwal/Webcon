EDUCATION NEW YORK INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY | GPA : 3.5 7 MS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE Expected Graduation December 2017 | Manhattan, New York SANJIVANI R URAL EDUCATION SOCIETY,COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING BE IN COMPUTER ENGINEERING August 2011 | Pune , India COURSEWORK GRADUATE Analysis of Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence , Topics in Database Management Systems , Programming Language, Biometrics, Theory of computer compilation . . EXPERIENCE Teaching Assistant| Om Gurudev, India, Dec 2012 - Sep 2014 Taught statistics for grade 11 and grade 12 students . It included the topics v ectors, matrices, derivatives, i ntegration, probability. SKILLS Languages and Frameworks: - Sql C Tools and Applications: Miner Netbeans Operating Systems: PROJECTS GETTING BEST US FARMER MARKET | Hive, MapReduce , Pig 10 Feb 2017 - 10 May 2017 This development project helps the user to find the best farmer from any state. D ata is loaded from data file u sing Pig and then user applies filters to choosen state is . Filtered data is stored in HDFS. iltered data is given to MapReduce which outputs the data to Hive. Using Hive Best Market is found . ENCRYPTION AND DECRYPTION OF CIPHER TEXT | Numpy, Scipy 1 Nov 2016 - 1 Dec 2016 Takes message and passes to affine cipher or vigenere cipher , encrypted , and displayed in a file. Encrypted text can also be passed to get decrypted text and it can be displayed in a file. Performed Priv ate and Public Key construction to implement these algorithms. LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM | Python, Html, CSS, MySQL 1 Oct 2016 - 1 Dec 2016 C reated pages in Python, Html and CSS to give library i nformation and records of books i n library. Student and staff records stored in Database along with borrow and return date of books. Fine is applied for delay in returning of books. DATA ANALYSIS WITH PANDAS |Python, Pandas 20 Feb 2016 - 20 May 2 016 Analysis project predicts futur e probability of population patients with diabetes. Load data using Pandas and developed classifier algorithm to classify data . DATA ANALYSIS WITH EXCEL SHEET | Python , Excel, PDF 1 Feb 2016 - 1 April 2016 Found out Acceptance R ate and Rejection Rate of Biometric data by converting d ata file .xls file and using python for calculations. Ba yes classification model data to analyze d ata . machine learning algorithm and Weka to analyze d ata . This dat a analysis helped to know the factors that helped in reduction of Rejection Rate and increase the security level of application. n PDF.
